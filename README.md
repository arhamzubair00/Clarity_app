## Front End


### feature
<!-- Animated background of the application is done purely with use of CSS and this is something I'm the most proud of.
It consists of a div with gradient moving basically left to right and top to bottom.
Inside the div, there is an empty list that serves as those animated squares in the background.
```
<div class="gradient"></div>
<ul class="circles">
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
```

While gradient is just translating its position in two axis, list elements are moving vertically, rotating and decreasing opacity at the same time in a loop.

```
.gradient {
  z-index: -10;
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(-45deg, #8741e6, #b2519f, #da5e58, #d8b46e);
  background-size: 400% 400%;
  animation: my-gradient 10s ease infinite;
  overflow: hidden;
}

@keyframes my-gradient {
  0% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
  50% {
    background-position: 100% 50%;
  }
  100% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
}

.circles{
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  z-index: -9;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.circles li{
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  list-style: none;
  width: 40vw;
  height: 40vh;
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  animation: animate 25s linear infinite;
  bottom: -150px;
  
}

.circles li:nth-child(1){
  left: 25%;
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
  animation-delay: 0s;
}
``` -->

### Responsive Design
Lanping page is available for responsive designed
It could use some final touches, but overall I'd like to present examples below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="" ></td>
    <td><img src="" ></td>
  </tr>
</table>


## Conclusion

Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp was simply the most amazing learning experience in my life with teaching quality I've never seen before and that application is the final showdown of all the skills acquired during the bootcamp.
There is still so much to do, but it's mostly refactoring and working on the front end.
The only important bit that is really missing is Testing and any TDD, CI/CD principles, but realistically, considering the time given - that was a necessary sacrifice.
Considering that this application is shared effort, despite all those missing elements I think it is a viable product and it suffices to leave it in that state.
