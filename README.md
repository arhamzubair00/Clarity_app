## Back End

The application consisits of four models:

- User
	- Entire User logic was created using [DEVISE](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)
	- Added Authentication logic to each page

- Mood
  - A daily log of the user's mood or feelings.
  - Each mood object must be assigned an emoji.
  - If notes are added the can not exceeed 350 characters.
  - Only one per day.

- Task
	- Tasks are assigned to each day
  - Titles must have at lease 3 characters but no more than 32.

- Day
  - Each user has their own calendar which displays all the days
  - Each day has one mood log and can have many tasks
<!--
- Place
	- Photo attachment using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) as active_storage
	- Phisical object, schools of dance, music clubs with occuring dancing events
- Event
	- Photo attachment using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) as active_storage
	- Is taking place in "The Place" (duh!)
	- Created by User, owner of the Place
	- May have many attendants, groups and invites
- Invite
	- User can either add yourself to the even, invite someone else straight to the event or create a grou or add someone an existing group of people going together to the given event.
	- Each user story have differen routes and path and its carrying different sets of params throughout all views. Not challenging at all. Not even a bit...
- Group
	- Backbone of the aplication
	- Internal dashboard for group of people going together to that one given event in that one place.
	- Fully dynamic with responsive menu allowing to add participants and with build in chat created using WebSocket and ActionCable
- Review
	- After participating with some other user in an event or after beeing with him in a group you can leave a "review" at his profile pic that only you will be able to modify, a part of gamification aspect of the application, depending on rating of those reviews each user will progress with level and get a new achievement.
- Chatroom
	- Part of the live chat logic in Group model
- Message
	- Look above! -->

## Conclusion

Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp was simply the most amazing learning experience in my life with teaching quality I've never seen before and that application is the final showdown of all the skills acquired during the bootcamp.
There is still so much to do, but it's mostly refactoring and working on the front end.
The only important bit that is really missing is Testing and any TDD, CI/CD principles, but realistically, considering the time given - that was a necessary sacrifice.
Considering that this application is shared effort, despite all those missing elements I think it is a viable product and it suffices to leave it in that state.
